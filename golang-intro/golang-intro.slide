* Agenda

- A light hearted intro to *golang*
- I already know python why should I switch
- Some cool stuff
- Who is the creator and who uses it.


* A tribute to the demo gods

.play -edit src/hello.go

* Why should I swtich

- I already know python so why a new language
- Cross compiling is as easy as native compiling
- You Dont write complex makefiles, or have to bend you head for complex build systems
- The tooling is awsome.

* Who created it

The creators of UNIX

- Ken Thompson (Turing award winner)
- Rob Pike
- Russ Cox

Legend has it, Ken and Rob were waiting for a project to compile, they thougth of redesigning a language
that was modern enough and could tackle the scale at google.

* Structure of a Typical go program

- package
- imports
- globla vars
- funcs
- func *main*

* Is go Object oriented.

- Although you can use it as an object oriented langugage, it is not.
- It feels like one.

* Let me try to sell go

- Cross compiling
- Pretty loaded standard library (battries included)
- All round development, Benchmarking and Testing bundled in the languge
- Relatively leaner build times
- Extensive tooling (more on that latter)

* Some more

- Looks and feels like Python
- Statically Typed
- Compiled
- Simple

* What are use cases of go

- Its typically used a systems langugage
- People use for web dev too
- Docker has been written in go.

* Lets start coding

* Values, Variables & Constants

.play -edit src/val_var.go

: The short variable declaration only works inside functions

* Loops

There is just one looping construct *for*

.play -edit src/loops.go

* Conditionals

.play -edit src/if-else.go

* Switch

.play -edit src/switch.go

* Arrays

.play -edit src/array.go

* Slices

.play -edit src/slice.go

* 2D Slice

.play -edit src/slice2.go
